| Project detail page overhaul | ✅ Complete | Per Manivel's spec: (1) Status dropdown in header matches 8-status list (editable in-place). (2) Dropped AdvanceStatusButton — replaced with 12-stage horizontal ProjectStepper highlighting completed stages via Check icon (derived from boi_locked, boq_completed, commissioning, etc.).

| BOI estimated site expenses | ✅ Complete | New card at bottom of BOI step — `EditableField` for estimated_site_expenses_budget (single aggregate NUMERIC), formatINR display, explanation sidebar. Feeds into BOQ budget analysis baseline + Actuals step margin calculation. |

## CODING STANDARDS — NON-NEGOTIABLE

### Error handling — always name the operation

```typescript
export async function someFunction(id: string) {
  const op = '[someFunction]';
  console.log(`${op} Starting for: ${id}`);
  try {
    if (!id) throw new Error(`${op} Missing required parameter: id`);
    // ... work
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`${op} Failed:`, {
      id,
      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
      stack: error instanceof Error ? error.stack : undefined,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    });
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Supabase queries — handle error and null separately

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('projects')
  .select('*, milestones:project_milestones(*)')
  .eq('id', projectId)
  .single();

if (error) {
  console.error('[getProject] Query failed:', { code: error.code, message: error.message, projectId });
  throw new Error(`Failed to fetch project: ${error.message}`);
}
if (!data) { console.warn('[getProject] Not found:', { projectId }); return null; }
return data;
```

### Financial calculations — decimal.js always

```typescript
import Decimal from 'decimal.js';
// NEVER: const gst = 10000 * 0.18  ← floating point error
const amt = new Decimal('10000.00');
const gst = amt.mul('0.18');
const total = amt.add(gst);
```

### Indian number formatting

```typescript
function formatINR(amount: number): string {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN', {
    style: 'currency', currency: 'INR',
    minimumFractionDigits: 0, maximumFractionDigits: 2,
  }).format(amount); // → ₹1,23,456
}
function shortINR(amount: number): string {
  if (amount >= 10_000_000) return `₹${(amount / 10_000_000).toFixed(1)}Cr`;
  if (amount >= 100_000)    return `₹${(amount / 100_000).toFixed(1)}L`;
  if (amount >= 1_000)      return `₹${(amount / 1_000).toFixed(0)}K`;
  return `₹${amount}`;
}
```

### Dates — UTC stored, IST displayed

```typescript
// Store: UTC ISO strings (timestamps) or 'YYYY-MM-DD' strings (date-only)
// Display: always convert to IST for Indian users
function toIST(utcTimestamp: string): string {
  return new Date(utcTimestamp).toLocaleString('en-IN', {
    timeZone: 'Asia/Kolkata',
    day: '2-digit', month: 'short', year: 'numeric',
    hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit',
  }); // → "20 Mar 2025, 02:30 PM"
}
```

### UUID — generate on client, not server

```typescript
// Enables offline record creation on mobile
const newRecord = {
  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  created_on_device_at: new Date().toISOString(),
};
```

### Supabase client — use packages/supabase factory

```typescript
// BROWSER — client components. Singleton. RLS enforced.
import { createClient } from '@repo/supabase/client';
const supabase = createClient();

// SERVER — server components, Server Actions, Route Handlers. RLS enforced.
import { createClient } from '@repo/supabase/server';
const supabase = await createClient();

// ADMIN — server only. Bypasses RLS. Use ONLY for system automation, nightly aggregations.
import { createAdminClient } from '@repo/supabase/admin';
const supabase = createAdminClient();

// MIDDLEWARE — session refresh in apps/erp/src/middleware.ts
import { updateSession } from '@repo/supabase/middleware';
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  return await updateSession(request);
}
```

### Sensitive fields — never in logs

Never log: `bank_account_number`, `aadhar_number`, `pan_number`, `gross_monthly`,
`basic_salary`, `ctc_monthly`, `ctc_annual`, `net_take_home`, `commission_amount`, `pf_employee`.

---

## NEVER DO — ABSOLUTE RULES

1. **Never hardcode** env variables, API keys, or Supabase project IDs in source files
2. **Never commit** `.env.local` — it is gitignored, never touches git
3. **Never use `any`** TypeScript type — always type properly using `packages/types/database.ts`
4. **Never bypass RLS** with secret key except for explicitly labelled admin/system operations
5. **Never use floats** for monetary values — always `decimal.js` or `NUMERIC(14,2)` in SQL
6. **Never edit** `packages/types/database.ts` by hand — it is auto-generated from live schema
7. **Never store files** in the database — Supabase Storage for files, DB stores path strings only
8. **Never write SQL** directly inside React components or page files
9. **Never push** directly to main — feature branch → PR → review → merge (once branching is set up)
10. **Never run** untested migrations on prod — dev first, verify, then prod

---

## DATABASE — KEY FACTS

- **134 tables**, 91 triggers, RLS on every table (verified March 29, 2026)
- **All migrations committed** to `supabase/migrations/` — 28+ files (001 through 012)
- **Run migrations** by pasting SQL into Supabase SQL Editor dashboard — no CLI needed
- **After every schema change**, regenerate types:
  ```bash
  npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id actqtzoxjilqnldnacqz --schema public > packages/types/database.ts
  ```

### System spine (how tables connect)

```
leads → proposals → projects → commissioning_reports → project_handovers
                                       ↓
                              om_contracts → om_visit_schedules → om_visit_reports
                                       ↓
                              customer_checkins → lead_referrals → (back to leads)
```

### The 10 roles (app_role enum)

`founder` | `hr_manager` | `sales_engineer` | `designer` | `project_manager` |
`purchase_officer` | `site_supervisor` | `om_technician` | `finance` | `customer`

**Handoff chain:** Sales → Designer → Sales (closure) → PM (BOM) → Purchase (PO, delivery) → PM (execution) → Supervisor (daily) → PM (QC, commissioning) → O&M

### Three-tier immutability model

- **Tier 1** — freely editable with audit log (operational records, proposals in draft)
- **Tier 2** — correction-by-new-record after lock period (daily site reports after 48h, approved proposals)
- **Tier 3** — immutable forever (invoices, payments, POs, salary history — corrections via counter-entries only)

### Financial year

April 1 boundary. All document numbers reset April 1.
Format: `SHIROI/INV/2025-26/0042`

---

## UI / DESIGN RULES

### Design assets (read before building any screen)

- Design system: `docs/Shiroi_ERP_Design_System.md` and `docs/Shiroi_ERP_Design_System.html`
- Brand guide: `docs/Shiroi_Energy_Brand_Guide_V6.html`
- AI Studio reference screens: `docs/` or `reference/` folder — use as reference for layout intent only

### Three surfaces

| Surface | Device | Style |
|---------|--------|-------|
| ERP web | Desktop | Dense, data-rich. Sidebar nav. Tables not cards. |
| Mobile field app | Smartphone | Large touch targets, offline-capable. Bottom tab nav. |
| Customer app | Smartphone | Consumer polish. Clean, spacious. No jargon. |

### 8 priority screens — ALL BUILT (Phase 1A)

1. ✅ Founder morning dashboard (ERP web) — cash, pipeline, alerts, KPI cards
2. ✅ Lead pipeline + lead detail (ERP web) — sales team daily driver
3. ✅ Proposal creation flow (ERP web) — BOM, margin logic
4. ✅ Project detail + milestones (ERP web) — PM primary workspace + 10-step stepper
5. ✅ Project cash position (ERP web) — most important financial screen
6. ✅ Daily site report (ERP web) — 48h lock, photo upload, Tier 2 correction
7. O&M visit checklist (Mobile) — deferred to Phase 2 (mobile app)
8. Service ticket lifecycle (Customer + ERP) — deferred to Phase 2

### Role-specific dashboards — ALL BUILT (Phase 2A)

- ✅ 10 roles: founder, hr_manager, sales_engineer, designer, project_manager, purchase_officer, site_supervisor, om_technician, finance, customer
- ✅ Role-adaptive /dashboard route with founder role switcher (?view_as=)
- ✅ Sectioned sidebar navigation per role
- ✅ PM 10-step project stepper (Details → Survey → BOM → BOQ → Delivery → Execution → QC → Liaison → Commissioning → AMC)
- ✅ KPI cards + My Tasks widget on every dashboard
- ✅ 142 tests passing, 0 type errors

### All ERP screens — COMPLETE (Phase 2B, April 2 2026)

57+ routes total, 0 type errors, all data-driven with Supabase queries:
- ✅ Procurement: `/procurement` (PO list with filters), `/deliveries`, `/vendor-payments`, `/msme-compliance`
- ✅ Inventory: `/inventory` (stock dashboard with cut-length tracking, filters, low-stock alerts), `/inventory/[id]` (detail + cut-length gauge)
- ✅ Vendors: `/vendors` (full vendor list with search/filter)
- ✅ Tasks: `/tasks` (all tasks across entities), `/my-tasks` (personal)
- ✅ Daily Reports: `/daily-reports` (all), `/my-reports` (personal)
- ✅ Finance: `/invoices`, `/payments` (tabbed: project payments overview + receipts), `/profitability`, `/cash`
- ✅ QC: `/qc-gates` (gate inspections)
- ✅ HR: `/hr/employees`, `/hr/leave`, `/hr/training`, `/hr/certifications`, `/hr/payroll`
- ✅ O&M: `/om/visits`, `/om/tickets`, `/om/amc`
- ✅ Sales: `/leads` (stage-based pipeline), `/leads/[id]` (tabbed detail: details/activities/tasks/proposal/files/payments), `/proposals`
- ✅ Liaison: `/liaison`, `/liaison/net-metering`
- ✅ Design: `/design` (design queue from leads), `/design/[leadId]`
- ✅ Reference: `/price-book`

### Contacts V2 — HubSpot-style CRM (April 4, 2026)

**Architecture:** Person (contacts) and Organization (companies) are separate entities. Company is optional (residential customers have no company). Linked via `contact_company_roles` junction table with role titles and active/ended status.

**Key decisions:**
- `first_name`/`last_name` split with auto-generated `name` display field
- `lifecycle_stage`: subscriber → lead → opportunity → customer → evangelist
- `entity_contacts` polymorphic junction: links contacts to leads, proposals, or projects with role labels
- `activities` + `activity_associations`: HubSpot-style engagement log (note, call, email, meeting, site_visit, whatsapp, task, status_change) linked to any entity
- Company optional for residential contacts — no forced company creation
- Backfill script: smart name splitting, company detection via regex patterns (Pvt, Ltd, LLP, Industries, etc.)

**Files:**
- Queries: `src/lib/contacts-queries.ts`, `src/lib/contacts-actions.ts`
- Components: `src/components/contacts/activity-timeline.tsx`, `contact-form.tsx`, `company-form.tsx`, `add-contact-dialog.tsx`, `entity-contacts-card.tsx`
- Pages: `/contacts`, `/contacts/[id]`, `/contacts/[id]/edit`, `/contacts/new`, `/companies`, `/companies/[id]`, `/companies/[id]/edit`, `/companies/new`

### HubSpot-style DataTable — Reusable (April 4, 2026)

**Architecture:** Single `<DataTable>` component used by leads, proposals, and extensible to all entity types. URL-driven sort/pagination via searchParams. Server-side data fetching.

**Key features:**
- Column picker: slide-out panel with searchable checkbox list (left) + drag-to-reorder (right)
- Saved views: `table_views` DB table persists columns, filters, sort per user. Tab bar UI with create/save/delete
- Per-column config: `column-config.ts` defines sortable, editable, format (badge/currency/date/phone/email), frozen, defaultVisible
- Checkbox selection with bulk action bar
- **Inline editing:** Double-click any editable cell to edit in-place. Supports text, number, select/badge dropdowns, date picker, phone, email. Enter to save, Escape to cancel. Server action with field-level validation and RLS enforcement.
- Column definitions: LEAD_COLUMNS (16), PROPOSAL_COLUMNS (12), PROJECT_COLUMNS (11), CONTACT_COLUMNS (8), COMPANY_COLUMNS (7)
- **All entity pages** now use DataTable: leads, proposals, projects, contacts, companies

**Files:**
- `src/components/data-table/data-table.tsx` — main component (with inline editing)
- `src/components/data-table/column-config.ts` — all column definitions
- `src/components/data-table/column-picker.tsx` — HubSpot-style column selector
- `src/components/data-table/view-tabs.tsx` — saved view tabs
- `src/lib/views-actions.ts` — server actions for view CRUD
- `src/lib/inline-edit-actions.ts` — server action for inline cell editing
- Wrapper components: `leads-table-wrapper.tsx`, `proposals-table-wrapper.tsx`, `projects-table-wrapper.tsx`, `contacts-table-wrapper.tsx`, `companies-table-wrapper.tsx`

### Field friction standards (mobile screens)

- 90-second rule: any mobile form completable in under 90 seconds
- Pre-populate every field that can be inferred
- Mandatory fields first, optional fields below the fold
- Sliders for percentages, quick-tap presets for counts, voice-to-text for free text

## WORKFLOW (how this project is built)

```
Claude Code writes code in this repo
  ↓
Vivek reviews every file before committing
  ↓
git add → git commit → git push
  ↓
SQL migrations: paste into Supabase SQL Editor (dev first, then prod)
  ↓
Schema change: regenerate types immediately
```

No autonomous commits to main. No skipping review. No "I'll clean this up later."

**After completing any task or milestone**, immediately update:
1. The **CURRENT STATE** table in this file (`CLAUDE.md`) — mark items as ✅ and update details
2. The **status table + relevant sections** in `docs/SHIROI_MASTER_REFERENCE_3_0.md`
3. Remove completed items from "Immediate next steps" lists in both files
This is automatic — do not wait for Vivek to ask.

## KNOWN COMPLEXITIES — READ BEFORE TOUCHING THESE AREAS

- **CEIG clearance gate:** DB trigger blocks TNEB net metering submission until CEIG is approved. `net_metering_applications` table. Do not work around this trigger.
- **IR test auto-ticket:** IR reading < 0.5 MΩ → DB trigger auto-creates critical service ticket (4h SLA). `commissioning_reports` and `om_visit_reports`. Non-negotiable.
- **Sum-to-100% triggers:** `proposal_payment_schedule` percentages must sum to exactly 100% before a proposal can leave draft status. `project_milestone_weights` must sum to 100% per segment+system_type. DB triggers enforce both.
- **Phone uniqueness:** Partial unique index on `leads.phone` blocks duplicate active leads. Disqualified and lost leads excluded from the uniqueness check.
- **Tasks entity model:** `tasks` table uses `entity_type + entity_id` (not separate task tables per domain). `entity_type` values: `project` | `lead` | `om_ticket` | `procurement` | `hr`.
- **Salary RLS:** `employee_compensation` and `salary_increment_history` — readable ONLY by: the employee (own record), their direct manager, `hr_manager`, `founder`. Strictly enforced at DB level.
- **Offline sync pattern:** Mobile writes go to WatermelonDB first. Background sync to Supabase. `sync_status` column on affected tables: `local_only` | `syncing` | `synced` | `sync_failed`. Never lose data.
- **Financial year boundary:** April 1. Document number sequences reset. `generate_doc_number()` DB function handles this automatically.
- **MSME 45-day rule:** Vendor payments to MSME suppliers legally due within 45 days of delivery. `vendor_payments` table tracks per-payment dates. Alert on Day 40.

*This file is maintained by Vivek. Update it whenever a major decision is made.*
*Last updated: April 9, 2026 — Project detail page overhaul per Manivel's spec. (1) Migration 033: project detail fields (scope_la/civil/meter, cable_brand/model, billing_address, location_map_link, order_date, primary_contact_id FK→contacts) + project_site_expenses voucher workflow (voucher_number, expense_category, status pending/approved/rejected/auto_approved, submitted_by/at, approved_by/at, rejected_reason, receipt_file_path). Existing rows marked auto_approved so only new submissions enter the queue. (2) Migration 034: estimated_site_expenses_budget on projects — PM-editable aggregate for general site expenses. (3) New detail page layout: ProjectHeader with editable 8-status dropdown, horizontal 12-stage ProjectStepper (Details → Survey → BOI → BOQ → Delivery → Execution → Actuals → QC → Liaison → Commissioning → Free AMC → Documents) with completed-stage highlights from `deriveCompletedStages()`. Dropped AdvanceStatusButton + old tab strip. (4) Details tab now renders 4 editable boxes: FinancialBox (role-gated PM/founder/finance/sales_engineer, contracted value + BOQ total + site expenses + margin %), SystemConfigBox (all dropdowns: size, type on-grid/off-grid/hybrid, mounting elevated/low-raise/minirail/long-rail/customized, panel/inverter/battery/cable brand+model, scope_la/civil/meter shiroi\|client, remarks), CustomerInfoBox (primary_contact_id picker with 250ms debounced search against contacts table, site addr, billing addr, location_map_link Google Maps URL), TimelineTeamBox (6 date fields + PM + site_supervisor dropdowns — Team merged here per spec). (5) New Actuals stepper step: BOQ Total + approved Site Expenses KPI strip, auto-populated BOQ items table, inline voucher form, voucher history with status badges, margin color coding. (6) New Documents tab merges HandoverPack + ProjectFiles + LeadFiles (proposal-files bucket). (7) Removed: Notes card, Milestones/Delays/Change Orders/Reports tabs, side PDF link. (8) `/vouchers` PM approval queue: KPI strip, project rollup, Approve + Reject-with-reason Dialog. Sidebar link under new "Approvals" section for founder/project_manager/finance. Receipt icon registered in sidebar ICON_MAP. (9) BOI step has new "Estimated Site Expenses (General)" card at the bottom — single aggregate EditableField that becomes the baseline in BOQ budget analysis + Actuals margin. (10) `site-expenses-actions.ts` server actions (submit/approve/reject/getPending/getProject), `project-detail-actions.ts` (updateProjectField with FINANCIAL_FIELDS gate, setProjectStatus, getProjectFinancials, searchContactsLite, getActiveEmployeesLite). tsc --noEmit: 0 errors. Next: employee testing week, prod deployment.*
